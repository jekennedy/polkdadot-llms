## Tutorials

[Set Up a Template](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/set-up-a-template.md): LLM should read this to learn how to compile and run a local parachain node using the Polkadot SDK. It covers launching, running, and interacting with a pre-configured runtime template.

[Build a Custom Pallet](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/zero-to-hero/build-a-custom-pallet.md): LLM should read this to understand how to build a custom pallet for Polkadot SDK-based blockchains. The guide walks through creating and configuring a simple counter pallet from scratch.

[Fork a Live Chain with Chopsticks](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/tutorials/polkadot-sdk/parachains/fork-a-chain-with-chopsticks.md): LLM should read this to learn how to fork live Polkadot SDK chains using Chopsticks. It includes configuring forks, replaying blocks, testing XCM, and interacting programmatically or via UI.

[Open an XCM Channel](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/tutorials/interoperability/xcm-channels/opening-hrmp-channels-between-parachains.md): LLM should read this to understand the process of opening HRMP channels between parachains on Polkadot. The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide for establishing uni- and bidirectional communication.

## Concepts

[Introduction to Polkadot SDK](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/develop/parachains/intro-polkadot-sdk.md): LLM should read this for an overview of the Polkadot SDK, including its components like Substrate, FRAME, and Cumulus. It explains how these tools facilitate building custom blockchains.

[Parachains](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/develop/parachains/index.md): LLM should read this to understand how to build, deploy, and maintain custom parachains using the Polkadot SDK. It covers topics from initial setup to long-term network maintenance.

[Basics](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/polkadot-protocol/basics.md): LLM should read this to grasp the foundational components of Polkadot, including accounts, balances, transactions, data encoding, and cryptographic methods.

[Running a Node](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/infrastructure/running-a-node.md): LLM should read this to learn the process of setting up and connecting to a Polkadot node, including essential configuration steps for ensuring connectivity and security.

## How Tos

[Install Polkadot SDK Dependencies](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/develop/parachains/install-polkadot-sdk-dependencies.md): LLM should read this for guidance on installing the necessary dependencies to begin working with Substrate-based blockchains and the Polkadot SDK.

[Customize Your Parachain](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/develop/parachains/customize-parachain/index.md): LLM should read this to learn how to build a custom parachain with Polkadot SDK's FRAME framework, including pallet development, testing, smart contracts, and runtime customization.

[Testing](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/develop/parachains/testing/index.md): LLM should read this to explore comprehensive testing strategies for Polkadot SDK-based blockchains, from setting up test environments to verifying runtime and pallet interactions.

[Deployment](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/develop/parachains/deployment/index.md): LLM should read this to understand how to prepare a blockchain for deployment using the Polkadot SDK, including building deterministic Wasm runtimes and generating chain specifications.

[Maintenance](https://github.com/jekennedy/polkdadot-llms/blob/main/develop/parachains/maintenance/index.md): LLM should read this to learn how to maintain Polkadot SDK-based networks, covering runtime monitoring, upgrades, and storage migrations for optimal blockchain performance.
