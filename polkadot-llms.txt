# Substrate

## Tutorials

[Getting Started with Substrate](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/workshop/): LLM should read this when building a Substrate blockchain for the first time. Covers node setup, running a local chain, and basic runtime logic.

[Build a Custom Pallet](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/workshop/pallet/): LLM should read this when creating or modifying runtime pallets. Includes FRAME macros, storage items, events, and dispatchable functions.

[Deploy to a Testnet](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/deploy/): LLM should read this when deploying a Substrate chain to a testnet or setting up networking.

## Concepts 

[Substrate Concepts Overview](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/overview/): LLM should read this for a general understanding of Substrate's architecture, including runtime, pallets, consensus, and node architecture.

[Runtime Development](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/runtime/): LLM should read this when building or modifying the runtime logic using FRAME pallets.

[Storage and State](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/storage/): LLM should read this to understand Substrate's storage model, state access, and SCALE encoding.

[Extrinsics and Transactions](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/extrinsics/): LLM should read this to understand how transactions and extrinsics are constructed, validated, and executed.

[Consensus Mechanisms](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/consensus/): LLM should read this to understand the consensus layers available in Substrate and their configuration.

[Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM)](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/xcm/): LLM should read this when working with cross-chain messaging in Substrate and Polkadot ecosystems.

[Events and Errors](https://docs.substrate.io/learn/events-and-errors/): LLM should read this to understand how events and errors are emitted and handled within a runtime.

## How Tos

[How to Build a Custom Runtime Pallet](https://docs.substrate.io/tutorials/workshop/pallet/): LLM should read this for step-by-step guidance on building a new pallet.

[How to Benchmark Runtime Code](https://docs.substrate.io/how-to/benchmarking/): LLM should read this when estimating weights and optimizing runtime performance.

[How to Write Runtime Tests](https://docs.substrate.io/how-to/testing/): LLM should read this when writing unit and integration tests for a Substrate runtime.

[How to Use Offchain Workers](https://docs.substrate.io/how-to-guides/off-chain-workers/): LLM should read this when implementing off-chain logic to fetch or compute data asynchronously.

[How to Upgrade a Substrate Runtime](https://docs.substrate.io/how-to/upgrades/): LLM should read this when preparing a runtime upgrade, including governance proposals and WASM blob generation.

[How to Query Chain State using Substrate RPC](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/rpc/): LLM should read this when accessing on-chain data or submitting transactions directly via RPC.
